  		<h2>Sushiya</h2>
  		<p>Sushi when its done right is pretty good, and Sushiya does a pretty decent job on their sushi.  As far as prices go their sushi is fairly affordable ($6-$10 per roll) and they have a wide variety of choices including tempura and edamame. Bottom line, if you&#39re a sushi lover then this is the place for you.

      <h2>Kohinoor</h2>
      <p>This restaurant has the most ridiculously good Indian food I have ever had and their side dishes are a huge part in what makes it awesome, their mango lassis are to die for, and the atmosphere is great the artwork on the walls is breathtaking.  If you are a vegan or a vegetarian the menu is really great and has a lot of options for you.  The price is a little more on the expensive side ($20 a plate) but it&#39s great quality food and when you leave don&#39t forget to try the breath freshener mix at the counter, it tastes like licorice and is awesome.

      <h2>Krispy Kremes</h2>
      <p>Krispy Kreme&#39s is a must have if you&#39ve never gone; it&#39s a really fun place to get doughnuts and it&#39s only doughnut place I know of that has a drive through.  Every month or so they go through new flavors of specialty doughnuts and you can see how the doughnuts are made if you go inside.  Also if you go when their hot doughnut light is on, you can get a free hot classic doughnut with the doughnut you order, and hot doughnuts are the bomb.

      <h2>Thai Evergreen</h2>
      <p>Thai Evergreen is really good thai restaurant in Orem next to Walmart, the owner are always super friendly and polite and they make really good curries, especially Panang curry.  The price is about $8 per dish which is fairly average for Thai food and if you want you can eat in or do carry out.  If you like Thai food you&#39ll really like this place and if you don&#39t, you should learn to like thai food. :P
