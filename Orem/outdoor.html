      <h2>Community Park</h2>
      <p>The community park in Orem is awesome, its an open fields next to Mountain View High School and a Fitness Center (if you get a membership you can use their indoor pool).  There are tennis courts, a baseball field and playground as well as open bathrooms for the public.  My personal favorite aspect of the park is the 1/2 running loop which is great if you enjoy running outside.  You can still use the park in winter though the bathroom do get closed and the running loop can get icy.  All in all, its one of my favorite parks in Utah.

      <h2>Sundance Resort</h2>
      <p>Sundance Resort its a great place to go in all seasons; during the winter the ski lifts are up and the film festival happens and in summer they do moonlight lift rides which are perfect for dates or just fun if get some blankets and go with your friends.  The resort is kinda pricey to buy things from but super pretty to walk around in.  Its really fun to visit around Halloween especially, and if you have the chance you should totally go.
