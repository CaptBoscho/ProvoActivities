  		<h2>Indian Palace</h2>
  		<p>Indian cuisine is amazing and if you already know that then you will definitely like the Indian Palace.  They serve traditional Indian dishes ranging from Paneer Masala to Lamb Vindaloo.  If you are a vegetarian or have vegetarian friends this place is great as it has a rather large diverse vegetarian and even vegan menu.   The dishes hear are fairly expensive though and range from a price of $12 and up most of the time.  However, if Indian food is you thing its totally worth it.
