  		<h2>Bridal Veil Falls</h2>
  		<p>This is a great trail whether you like hiking or not.  Its a bit of a drive from BYU but its easy to find; just follow university ave until you see a waterfall with a parking lot next to it.  This site is fairly popular however, it&#39d be hard not to be as there are so many great things about it.   You don&#39t have to hike to see the waterfall as its right off the road, however you can hike the trail to get closer to the waterfall.  Also if you enjoy jogging there&#39s a great running path that goes past the falls and around campsites in the area.  At the base of the falls there is also a fish pond were you can feed the local trout with provided fish feed.  Its super fun for you and your friends whether you want exert yourself or not.

      <h2>Scout Falls</h2>
      <p>This hike is about a mile long located on the Timpooneke Trail; its fun to walk and its pretty decent workout if you run it.  The path is very sheltered from the sun by all the local plant life; some of which is edible (wild mint, strawberries, raspberries, and indian paintbrush).  It is also a little wet as a couple of small streams cross the trail, and at the end a little climbing is needed to get past a large tree.  Its beautiful trail especially in the summer heat, just make sure to fill out the ranger&#39s clipboard at the entrance before you go; just to be safe.

      <h2>Kiwanis Park</h2>
      <p>If your a park person Kiwanis park is great; its a 3 minute drive from campus (roughly a 20 minute walk) has a lot of great facilities there including fire pits, a playground, and even power outlets and a bathroom.  Whether you like flag football or picnics this is a great park for any of those activities; and if your not a park person, I&#39d say donâ€™t knock it own before you try it.

      <h2>River Tubing</h2>
      <p>While summer is still around I would get on tubing down the Provo river, its super fun and great especially if its too hot out, as the provo river is cold all year round.  You can bring your own tube but, its really convenient to rent one from High Country Adventure as they also include a shuttle that takes you up river so you can tube back down and not need to worry about walking back to your car.  Also it means that you don&#39t have to buy an inner tube that you keep all year round but only use once.  Prices are pretty cheap and can be about $9 on a weekday if your in a group.  Its a great summer activity especially if you like being outside and getting wet.
