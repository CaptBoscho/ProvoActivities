      <h2>Provo City Library</h2>
      <p >If you need a quiet place to relax or pick up a good book the Provo City Library&#39s for you.  It&#39s located in beautiful brick building that was once a part of Brigham Young Academy not too far from campus but enough so that can have a respite from the stress of school life.  It&#39s a place, if you want to go out and not spend a lot of money; and if your more of a social person who likes to be outside, the front lawn is a great place to lay out a blanket and hang out with friends.

      <h2>Velour</h2>
      <p>If music is your jam this place is for you, Velour is a music shop on center street that showcases local talent and is a great if your into indie folk music.  Tickets are fairly affordable (usually no more than $20), and if you want to preform yourself they host an open mic every Tuesday ($2 to play $3 to watch).  If you&#39re on the fence about performing I would recommend doing it just once, its a fun experience whether your preforming or listening and the atmosphere is super positive and uplifting.

      <h2>Country Dancing</h2>
      <p>Country Dancing is a super great way to have fun and meet new people; the Utah Country Dance club hosts and teaches lessons in dance every Wednesday and Saturday for super cheap ($4-$6).  The dances aren’t necessarily always country, they can range from swing, to square, to classy dances from the 50&#39s you totally forgot about, like the two step.   If dancing isn’t your strong suit don’t worry, the main thing is to have fun and if you look a silly in the process, that&#39s half the fun.
